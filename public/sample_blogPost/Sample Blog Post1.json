Carry a refillable water bottle (there are free refill stations in most coworking spaces!), eat plant-based once a day, and support eco-conscious hostels. Choose shared transport or cycling for city commutes, and join local clean-up events. By making a few swaps, you’ll help keep paradise pristine for everyone—locals, nomads, and wildlife alike." }
