  excerpt: "Forget the usual crowded island scene—Koh Lanta has quietly become Southeast Asia’s leading eco-friendly haven for remote workers. With coworking spaces built from bamboo, local initiatives to protect marine life, and a community driven by purpose as much as productivity, this is where digital nomads discover a greener, more meaningful way to live and work. Find out why Koh Lanta is the ultimate destination for conscious nomads who want both connection and conservation.",
