# Performance Budgets Documentation

## Overview

This document defines the performance budgets for the Sustainable Eco-Friendly Digital Nomads Directory MVP. Performance budgets are quantifiable thresholds that help us ensure the application meets our performance goals. These budgets serve as guardrails for development decisions and help us maintain a high-quality user experience.

## Why Performance Budgets Matter

- **User Experience**: Research shows users abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load.
- **SEO Ranking**: Page speed is a significant ranking factor for search engines.
- **Conversion Rates**: Faster sites have higher conversion rates and lower bounce rates.
- **Accessibility**: Performance optimizations often improve accessibility for users with slower connections.

## Budget Categories

Our performance budgets are divided into several categories:

### 1. Page Load Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Acceptable | Critical |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|---------|
| FCP (First Contentful Paint) | Time until the first text/image is displayed | 1500ms | 2500ms | 3500ms |
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | Time until the largest content element is displayed | 2500ms | 4000ms | 6000ms |
| TTI (Time to Interactive) | Time until the page becomes fully interactive | 3500ms | 5000ms | 7500ms |
| FID (First Input Delay) | Time from user input to response | 100ms | 300ms | 500ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Measure of visual stability | 0.1 | 0.25 | 0.5 |
| TBT (Total Blocking Time) | Sum of "blocking time" for long tasks | 200ms | 500ms | 800ms |

### 2. Resource Size Budgets

| Resource | Target | Acceptable | Critical |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| Total Size | 900KB | 1200KB | 1500KB |
| JavaScript | 350KB | 500KB | 700KB |
| CSS | 75KB | 100KB | 150KB |
| Images | 400KB | 600KB | 800KB |
| Fonts | 75KB | 125KB | 200KB |

### 3. API Response Times

| API Endpoint | Target | Acceptable | Critical |
|--------------|--------|------------|---------|
| Listings | 300ms | 600ms | 1000ms |
| Search | 500ms | 800ms | 1200ms |
| Map Data | 400ms | 700ms | 1100ms |
| User Profile | 250ms | 500ms | 800ms |

### 4. Component-Specific Metrics

#### Map Rendering
- Initial Load: 800ms target (1200ms acceptable)
- Pan/Zoom: 50ms target (100ms acceptable)
- Marker Clustering: 100ms target (200ms acceptable)

#### Image Loading
- Listing Thumbnails: 200ms target (500ms acceptable)
- Hero Images: 500ms target (800ms acceptable)
- Lazy-Loaded Images: 300ms target (600ms acceptable)

#### SSR Caching
- Cache Hit: 80ms target (150ms acceptable)
- Cache Miss: 1000ms target (1500ms acceptable)
- Cache Invalidation: 200ms target (400ms acceptable)

### 5. Server Resource Utilization

| Resource | Target | Acceptable | Critical |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| CPU | 40% | 60% | 80% |
| Memory | 50% | 70% | 85% |
| Disk I/O | 30% | 50% | 75% |

## Measurement and Enforcement

- We will use automated testing tools to measure performance against these budgets.
- Performance budgets will be monitored in CI/CD pipelines.
- Alerts will be triggered when metrics cross thresholds.
- PR reviews should include performance impact assessments.

## Tools for Measuring Performance

- Lighthouse (Google Chrome)
- Web Vitals Library
- Custom Performance Monitoring Dashboard
- Next.js Analytics
- Browser DevTools Performance Panel

## Budget Adjustments

These budgets may be revised based on:
- User feedback
- Business requirements
- Technology changes
- Competitive analysis

Any changes to performance budgets must be documented and communicated to the team.
