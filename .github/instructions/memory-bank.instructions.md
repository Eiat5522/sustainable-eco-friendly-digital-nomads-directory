🧠 GitHub Copilot's Memory Bank

GitHub Copilot is designed to reset its memory completely between sessions, making it essential to maintain thorough documentation. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task to ensure continuity and context - this is not optional.

🗂️ Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy to ensure that essential project context and technical details are established before documenting ongoing progress and changes:

graph TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    AC --> P[progress.md]

✅ Core Files (Required)

projectbrief.md

Foundation document that shapes all other files

Created at project start if it doesn't exist

Defines core requirements and goals

Source of truth for project scope

productContext.md

Why this project exists

Problems it solves

How it should work

User experience goals

activeContext.md

Current work focus

Recent changes

Next steps

Active decisions and considerations

Important patterns and preferences

Learnings and project insights

systemPatterns.md

System architecture

Key technical decisions

Design patterns in use

Component relationships

Critical implementation paths

techContext.md

Technologies used

Development setup

Technical constraints

Dependencies

Tool usage patterns

progress.md

What works

What's left to build

Current status

Known issues

Evolution of project decisions

📦 Additional Context

Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:

Complex feature documentation

Integration specifications

API documentation

Testing strategies

Deployment procedures

📝 Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur under the following conditions:

Discovering new project patterns

After implementing significant changes

When user requests with update memory bank (MUST review ALL files)

When context needs clarification

graph TD
    Start[Update Process]
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    Start --> Process

⚡ Reminder: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
