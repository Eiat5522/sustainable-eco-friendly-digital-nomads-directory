[Previous content remains unchanged]

## 🔍 Reflection Process
1. 📊 Monitor interactions for:
     - 💬 User feedback during conversations
     - 🔄 Multi-step operations
     - 🧩 Complex code generation tasks

2. 🧠 When triggered, analyze:
     - 📁 Active .github folder rules
     - 📈 User feedback patterns
     - 🎯 Areas for improvement

3. 🚀 Improvement cycle:
     - ✏️ Generate specific suggestions
     - 📝 Present changes as diffs
     - ✅ Apply approved changes
     - ⏩ Continue with original task

## ⚠️ Constraints
- 🔍 Only reflect on substantial interactions
- 📋 Require active .github rules
- 🛠️ Maintain existing coding standards
