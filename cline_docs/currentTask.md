# Current Task (cline_docs/currentTask.md) - Image Optimization Phase

## Current Objective
- **Currently in Phase 1: Image Optimization Implementation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Focus on implementing comprehensive image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Setting up proper configuration and best practices for image handling

## Relevant Context
- Project structure established in `/app-scaffold/`
- Current listing images in `app-scaffold/public/images/listings/`
- Initial image components in place but need optimization
- Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router features available

## Implementation Plan:

1. **Image Component Enhancement: ✓**
   - ✓ Upgrade all image components to use Next.js Image with optimizations
   - ✓ Implement responsive image sizes
   - ✓ Add blur placeholders for better loading experience
   - ✓ Configure proper quality settings

2. **Configuration Setup: ✓**
   - ✓ Update next.config.js with proper image configurations
   - ✓ Set up remotePatterns for external images
   - ✓ Configure image optimization settings

3. **Performance Optimization: In Progress**
   - ✓ Implement proper lazy loading
   - ✓ Set up responsive image sizes
   - ✓ Configure blur placeholders
   - ⚡ Monitor and fine-tune quality settings based on performance

4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Test image loading performance
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Check layout stability
   - Validate blur placeholder functionality

## Next Steps (Immediate Tasks):
1. Run performance tests on optimized images
2. Validate layout stability across different screen sizes
3. Test blur placeholder effectiveness
4. Document image optimization configurations

## Technical Notes
- Use Next.js 15.3.2's built-in Image component
- Follow best practices for image optimization
- Consider both performance and visual quality
- Maintain proper types for image props
- Ensure layout stability during image loading

## Success Metrics:
- Image load times under 2s
- No layout shifts during loading
- Proper responsive behavior
- Working blur placeholders
- Optimized file sizes

## Future Considerations:
- Prepare for CMS integration
- Plan for dynamic image loading
- Consider CDN implementation
- Scale image optimization for larger datasets
