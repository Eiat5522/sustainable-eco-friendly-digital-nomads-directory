## Pros & Cons

### Strapi CE

#### Pros
- Complete ownership and control
- Unlimited API usage and users
- Highly customizable (plugins, extensions)
- All content stays on your infrastructure
- Robust permissions system
- Growing ecosystem and community

#### Cons
- Requires server setup and maintenance
- Database backups/reliability on you
- Higher operational complexity
- Upgrade process can be challenging
- Image processing limited without plugins

### Sanity

#### Pros
- No infrastructure to maintain
- Built-in CDN and image processing
- Real-time collaboration features
- Structured content (portable text)
- Solid developer experience
- No self-hosting complexity

#### Cons
- Usage limits (on free tier)
- Less control over infrastructure
- Costs can grow with usage (paid tiers)
- Slightly steeper learning curve for content schema
- Customization limited to what platform allows

## Project-Specific Considerations

- **Data Structure**: Our complex listing data structure would work well with either platform, though Sanity's schema-as-code approach may offer more flexibility for sophisticated relationships
- **Asset Management**: Both handle images well, but Sanity has better built-in image processing capabilities
- **Deployment**: Strapi would require setting up deployment and database management, while Sanity is fully managed
- **Future Growth**: Usage limits on Sanity's free tier could become an issue as the directory grows
- **Developer Experience**: Both integrate well with Next.js, though Sanity has more built-in tooling specifically for the Next.js ecosystem
- **Budget**: Self-hosting Strapi would require computing resources, while Sanity could remain on free tier for early development

## Recommendation

For the Sustainable Eco-Friendly Digital Nomads Directory project, **Sanity** is recommended for the following reasons:

1. **Faster development**: No need to set up and maintain infrastructure
2. **Built-in image processing**: Better handling of gallery images and optimizations
3. **Free tier adequacy**: Current project scope fits within free tier limits
4. **Next.js integration**: Strong ecosystem integration with Next.js
5. **Focus on content**: Development effort can focus on features rather than CMS maintenance

This recommendation is made with the understanding that future growth may require upgrading to a paid tier, but the migration path is straightforward as the project scales.

## Implementation Path

1. Create Sanity project and define content schemas
2. Migrate existing listings data to Sanity
3. Set up API integration with Next.js frontend
4. Configure image processing pipelines
5. Set up roles and permissions (admin, editors)
6. Train team on content management workflow
