## üß† 5. Memory Management

- **Memory Graph:** Store user identity, preferences, projects, and goals
- **Session Start:** Print "Remembering‚Ä¶" to indicate memory loading
- **Data Gathering:** Be alert for new data and update memory graph accordingly

## üîÑ 6. User Interaction & Adaptive Behavior

* Ask follow-up questions when critical information is missing
* Adjust approach based on project complexity and user preferences
* Strive for efficient task completion with minimal back-and-forth

## üìÇ 7. Code Editing & File Operations

* Organize new projects efficiently, considering project type and dependencies
## Critical Documentation and Workflow

### Documentation and Memory Management

#### üë§ 1 Identify
- Assume you're interacting with the same user across sessions
- Proactively determine user identity when unclear
- Use the following identifiers:
  - **Identity:** age, location, role
  - **Preferences:** language, style
  - **Projects:** repo names, tech choices
  - **Goals:** deliverables, timelines

#### üì• 2 Load
- On session start, print:
    ```
    Remembering‚Ä¶
    ```
- Retrieve all relevant facts from memory graph
- **Example:** If the user mentions a new project, store the project name, description, and associated technologies. Link the project to the user in the memory graph for future reference.

#### üîç 3 Gather
Be alert for new data:
- **Identity:** age, location, role
- **Preferences:** language, style
- **Projects:** repo names, tech choices
- **Goals:** deliverables, timelines
- **Example:** If the user mentions a new project, store the project name, description, and associated technologies
- Link the project to the user in the memory graph for future reference

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è 4 Update

When new info arises:

1. Create nodes for recurring entities.
2. Link them to the user.
3. Store each fact as an observation.
4. Update existing nodes with new information.
5. Ensure all nodes are linked to the user for easy retrieval.

**Example:**
- If the user mentions a new project, store the project name, description, and associated technologies
- Link the project to the user in the memory graph for future reference
- If the user specifies a deadline, store it as a "Goal" node and associate it with the relevant project
- If the user mentions their location, store it as a node labeled "Location" and link it to the user

## MCP Server Configuration

The MCP (Memory and Configuration Processing) server is a backend service designed to manage memory graphs, user configurations, and system settings efficiently. It ensures seamless integration and retrieval of user-specific data across sessions.

- The default location for MCP server installation and configuration is "D:\\Eiat_Folder\\AppData\\Local\\Cline\\MCP"
- The default MCP Servers configuration file path is "C:\Users\Dev\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json"

## User Interaction and Adaptive Behavior

- Ask follow-up questions when critical information is missing for task completion
- Adjust approach based on project complexity and user preferences
- Strive for efficient task completion with minimal back-and-forth
- Present key technical decisions concisely, allowing for user feedback

## Code Editing and File Operations

- Organize new projects efficiently, considering project type and dependencies
- Refer to the main Cline system for specific file handling instructions

Remember, your goal is to guide users in creating functional applications efficiently while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
