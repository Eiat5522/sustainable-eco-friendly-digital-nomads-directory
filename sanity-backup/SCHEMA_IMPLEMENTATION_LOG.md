# Sanity Schema Implementation Log

## Review Summary (May 15, 2025)

- All core and supporting schemas are defined and imported in `schemas/index.js`.
- Validation rules are present for required fields, min/max values, and custom logic (e.g., price ranges, group sizes).
- Relationships are established via references (e.g., listing to city, user to reviews, event to city/listing).
- Shared fields (imageWithAlt, slugField, descriptionField) are used for consistency and DRYness.
- Preview configuration is implemented in `config/preview.js` and integrated into the desk structure.
- Conditional fields and hidden logic are used for category-specific data.
- Custom input components are recommended for:
  - Rich text fields (e.g., ecoNotesDetailed, descriptionLong)
  - Tag arrays (ecoFocusTags, customTags)
  - Image galleries (galleryImages)
- All schemas are ready for further refinement and content team review.

## Next Steps
- Review with content team for any missing validation or relationships.
- Implement custom input components for rich text, tags, and image galleries.
- Finalize preview configuration and test with real content.
- Document any schema changes and update editor guides.
