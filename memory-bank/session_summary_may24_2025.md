- **CMS Integration**: Sanity fully configured
- **Database**: MongoDB integration established
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive across all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on critical endpoints

## 📋 Next Session Priorities

### Available Parallel Workstreams (No Dependencies)

1. **WORKSTREAM B**: Data & CMS Integration (Task 9)
   - Python migration script development
   - Image processing pipeline
   - Estimated: 5-7 hours

2. **WORKSTREAM C**: Search & User Features (Task 10) - USER HANDLING
   - Advanced search functionality
   - User authentication integration
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours

3. **WORKSTREAM D**: Authentication System (Task 11)
   - NextAuth.js setup
   - Role-based access control
   - Estimated: 4-5 hours

### Sequential Dependencies

- **WORKSTREAM E**: Integration & Testing (requires A, B, C completion)
- **WORKSTREAM F**: Polish & Optimization (requires E completion)

## 💡 Key Insights for Next Developer

### User Preferences (Eiat)

- **Communication Style**: Direct, efficiency-focused
- **Work Pattern**: Prefers steamrolling through tasks
- **Technical Approach**: Wants parallel workstream execution
- **Code Quality**: Makes manual refinements, values robust implementations

### Development Approach

- Start with file exploration before making changes
- Check existing implementations before creating new ones
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Use consistent patterns across API endpoints
- Follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions

### Current Focus Areas

- **User handling frontend** (WORKSTREAM C)
- **Backend data/CMS work needed** (WORKSTREAM B recommended for next session)
- **Authentication system** (WORKSTREAM D - ready for parallel execution)

## 📝 Session Completion Status

### Files Updated

- `task_008.txt` - Marked as completed
- `memory-bank/current_session_status.md` - Session status tracked
- `cline_docs/currentTask.md` - Progress documented

### Ready for Next Session

- Clear workstream priorities identified
- Technical foundation solid
- User preferences documented
- Context preserved for efficient continuation

---

**Next Developer**: Start with WORKSTREAM B (Data & CMS Integration) as WORKSTREAM C (Search & User Features) is being handled by user on frontend. Focus on Python migration scripts and image processing pipeline.
