# Project Progress: PrismJS Vulnerability Resolution in Sanity

**Date:** May 14, 2025

**Goal:** Resolve persistent PrismJS vulnerability in the `sanity/` subdirectory.

**Overall Project Status (General):**
*(Copied from previous valid content, assuming this part is stable)*
- Next.js 15.3.2 app scaffolded with Tailwind CSS 4.1.6.
- Basic page structure and navigation implemented.
- Initial Sanity Studio setup complete (schema definition pending).
- Leaflet map integration for listing display is functional.
- User authentication flow (NextAuth.js) is partially implemented.
- Stripe payment integration is pending.
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Vercel is operational.

**Current Focus: Sanity PrismJS Vulnerability**

**Status:** **Blocked/Needs Further Investigation**

**Completed Steps (Specific to PrismJS Vulnerability):**

1.  **Vulnerability Identification & Initial Analysis:**
    *   Used `npm audit` to confirm PrismJS vulnerabilities.
    *   Mapped dependency tree using knowledge graph tools.

2.  **Iterative `package.json` Updates & Overrides:**
    *   Updated direct dependencies: `@sanity/ui`, `prismjs`, `refractor`, `react-refractor`.
    *   Extensively configured `overrides` in `sanity/package.json` to enforce secure versions.

3.  **`.npmrc` Configuration:**
    *   Created and configured `sanity/.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`, `resolution-mode=highest`, `strict-peer-dependencies=false`, and `public-hoist-pattern` for prismjs-related packages.

4.  **Postinstall Patch Script (`patch-prismjs.js`):**
    *   Created `sanity/scripts/patch-prismjs.js` to find and update vulnerable PrismJS versions in `node_modules`.
    *   Converted script to ES module syntax.
    *   Added `postinstall` script to `sanity/package.json`.
    *   **Issue:** Last execution of the script reported patching 0 vulnerable dependencies, despite vulnerabilities remaining.

5.  **Dependency Installation & Auditing:**
    *   Numerous `npm install` and `npm audit` cycles.
    *   `npm audit` still reports 4 moderate severity PrismJS vulnerabilities, primarily linked through `@sanity/ui` -> `react-refractor` -> `refractor` -> `prismjs`.

**Pending Issues & Next Steps (Specific to PrismJS Vulnerability):**

*   **Persistent Vulnerability:** The core PrismJS vulnerability remains unresolved.
*   **Patch Script Ineffective:** The `sanity/scripts/patch-prismjs.js` script is not currently fixing the issue. Needs review and debugging.
*   **Further Investigation:** Explore alternative strategies:
    *   Deeper analysis of `npm ls prismjs` and `npm why prismjs` to pinpoint exact problematic paths after installs.
    *   Consider if `resolutions` (for Yarn) or more specific `overrides` are needed, or if there's a fundamental conflict with `@sanity/ui`'s older transitive dependencies that overrides cannot fully solve without breaking Sanity.
    *   Investigate if a different patch strategy for `node_modules` is required or if the current script has logic errors.
    *   Explore if Sanity community has known workarounds for this specific version of `@sanity/ui`.

**Key Files Modified (Specific to PrismJS Vulnerability):**

*   `sanity/package.json`
*   `sanity/.npmrc`
*   `sanity/scripts/patch-prismjs.js`

**What Works (General Project):**
*(Copied from previous valid content, assuming this part is stable)*
- Core Next.js application structure.
- Tailwind CSS integration.
- Basic routing and page rendering.
- Sanity Studio is now running and connected to the real project (projectId: sc70w3cr, dataset: production).
- Leaflet map displays correctly on client-side rendered components.

**What Needs Work / Blockers (General Project):**
*(Copied from previous valid content, assuming this part is stable)*
- Finalize Sanity schema design and content modeling.
- Complete user authentication and authorization.
- Implement Stripe payment processing.
- Resolve the **Sanity PrismJS vulnerability** (current focus).
- Populate CMS with initial listing data.
- Develop API routes for listings, reviews, and events.
- Build out the React Native mobile application.
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).
- Complete image sourcing for all listings.

**Decisions Made (General Project):**
*(Copied from previous valid content, assuming this part is stable)*
- Using Next.js App Router.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Sanity.io as the Headless CMS.
- MongoDB Atlas for user/auth data.
- Leaflet.js for maps.
- Vercel for deployment.
- Stripe for payments.
- NextAuth.js for authentication.
- Moved all Leaflet logic to client-only components.

**Open Questions / Risks (General Project):**
*(Copied from previous valid content, assuming this part is stable)*
- Scalability of free tiers for database and CMS as user base grows.
- Complexity of managing self-hosted Strapi vs. Sanity's free tier limitations.
- Ensuring consistent user experience between web and React Native app.
- Time required for content population.
- The **Sanity PrismJS vulnerability** is a current risk to dependency security.
