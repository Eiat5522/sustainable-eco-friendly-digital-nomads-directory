# Project Progress (Updated: May 16, 2025)

## Current Focus: Authentication & Testing Suite Implementation

### Current Status: API Routes Completed, Frontend Components Implemented

## Overall Project Status

- Next.js 15.3.2 app scaffolded with Tailwind CSS 4.1.6
- Sanity Studio setup complete, PrismJS vulnerability resolved, dependencies updated
- API routes implemented with Zod validation and proper error handling
- Frontend components developed with dark theme and eco-friendly design
- Leaflet map integration with clustering functionality
- Testing framework with Playwright established
- CI/CD pipeline configured for Netlify deployment


## Security Issue: PrismJS Vulnerability (Resolved)

### Resolution Status

- PrismJS vulnerability fully resolved:
  1. Version pinning in package.json (1.31.0)
  2. .npmrc security settings
  3. Updated package overrides and resolutions
  4. Performance and XSS protection patches applied

### Solutions Applied

1. Package overrides with exact versions:
   - prismjs@1.31.0
   - refractor@4.8.1
   - react-refractor@3.1.1
2. Strict .npmrc configuration
3. Security and performance patch scripts
4. Regular security audits

### Next Steps

1. Continue with Sanity schema and frontend integration
2. Monitor dependency updates
3. Maintain security audits
4. Progress with authentication and content preview
