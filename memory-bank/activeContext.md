Phase: 1.e - Interactive Map Integration

Current Focus:
- Leaflet.js map is now integrated using dynamic import with ssr: false to avoid SSR errors.
- StaticMapImage is used for SEO fallback.
- Listings and images are displaying correctly.
- Confirmed that the website is running and the styling is applied correctly.

Recent Changes:
- Refactored map logic into MapComponent.tsx (client-only).
- Updated MapContainer.tsx to use dynamic import with ssr: false.
- Ensured index.ts exports the correct map component.
- Directory structure for listing images created and populated for several venues.
- Updated next.config.mjs to include image domains.
- Added Tailwind configuration and plugins.
- Updated layout and home page styling.
- Updated listings page styling.

Next Steps:
- Continue image sourcing for remaining listings.
- Update listings data with correct image paths.
- Test map marker clustering and performance.
- Begin CMS and authentication integration.

Decisions:
- All Leaflet-based components use dynamic import with SSR disabled.
- StaticMapImage is required for SEO and fallback.
- Use feature branches and PRs for all new features and bugfixes.

Learnings:
- Leaflet.js must never be imported at the top level in SSR contexts.
- Dynamic import with SSR disabled is best practice for Next.js + Leaflet.
- Maintaining a static fallback improves SEO and UX.
