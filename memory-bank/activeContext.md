## Current Objectives

- Sanity CMS integration is now secure and up-to-date (PrismJS vulnerability resolved, dependencies updated, CSP/CORS/authentication enhanced)
- Implement and refine Sanity schema definitions
- Complete frontend integration and advanced GROQ queries
- Continue authentication and role-based access improvements
- Optimize image loading, map performance, and UI components


## Recent Changes

- Sanity CMS integration: PrismJS vulnerability resolved, patch script and dependency management updated, security configuration enhanced (CSP, CORS, authentication, .env, schema docs)
- All core document schemas implemented and validated
- Authentication system: NextAuth.js with multiple providers, MongoDB adapter, role-based access, secure session management
- UI: Shadcn-inspired components, SearchInput, city carousel, hero section, filter system
- Performance: Image optimization, map performance improvements

## Immediate Tasks

1. PrismJS Vulnerability Resolution
   - Debug current patch script
   - Explore alternative dependency overrides
   - Test isolation strategies
   - Document solution process

2. Sanity Schema Implementation ✅
   - Core schemas defined and implemented
   - Relationships established between entities
   - Validation rules implemented with custom error messages
   - Preview configuration pending
   - Need to add custom input components for specific fields

3. Authentication Setup ✅
   - NextAuth.js configured with multiple providers
   - Role-based access implemented
   - Protected routes and middleware in place
   - Social login (Google, GitHub) enabled
   - Session management enhanced with security features
   - MongoDB integration completed

4. Testing Implementation
   - Add authentication flow tests
   - Test role-based access scenarios
   - Validate schema relationships
   - Test content previews
   - Add API route tests

## Technical Focus

- Security audit of dependencies
- Sanity Studio configuration
- Image optimization pipeline
- Efficient map rendering
- UI component library
- Testing coverage
- Documentation maintenance

## Known Blockers

- PrismJS vulnerability hampering Sanity integration
- Image optimization strategy undefined
- Content preview configuration needed
- Map performance optimization required

## Key Decisions Needed

- Best approach for PrismJS vulnerability resolution
- Image optimization implementation
- Map clustering configuration
- Content preview strategy
- Testing strategy for authentication flows
