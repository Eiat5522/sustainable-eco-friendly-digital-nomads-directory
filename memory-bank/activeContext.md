# Active Context: Map Integration Enhancement

**Date:** May 14, 2025

**Primary Goal:** Enhance the map component with clustering, improved filtering, and mobile optimizations.

**Current State of Key Files:**

*   `src/components/map/MapComponent.tsx`:
    *   Basic Leaflet integration
    *   Marker placement
    *   Basic zoom controls
    *   Needs clustering implementation

*   `src/components/listings/FilterSidebar.tsx`:
    *   Category filters
    *   Eco-tag filters
    *   Needs real-time map integration

*   `src/styles/map.css`:
    *   Basic map styling
    *   Needs mobile-specific styles
    *   Cluster styling pending

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  Map Clustering:
    *   Use `leaflet.markercluster`
    *   Configure cluster thresholds
    *   Style cluster indicators
    *   Handle zoom level transitions

2.  Filter Integration:
    *   Real-time marker updates
    *   Category-based filtering
    *   Eco-tag filtering
    *   Combined filter logic

3.  Mobile Optimization:
    *   Touch-friendly controls
    *   Responsive container sizing
    *   Mobile-first filter UI
    *   Performance considerations

4.  State Management:
    *   Map bounds tracking
    *   View state persistence
    *   History management
    *   Filter state sync

5.  Performance:
    *   Lazy marker loading
    *   Efficient updates
    *   Loading indicators
    *   Error handling

**Testing Coverage:**
All features are covered by Playwright tests in `tests/map-integration.spec.ts`
