# Active Context: City Display & Carousel Implementation

**Last Updated:** May 23, 2025

## Current Focus: City Pages & Carousel UI/UX

We have successfully implemented the city detail pages and fixed critical issues with the city carousel component. The primary goal was to create a modern, engaging user experience for browsing cities and their listings.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **City Detail Pages (`/app/city/[slug]/page.tsx`):**
    *   Implemented a visually appealing hero section with parallax background images.
    *   Integrated dynamic content sections using Framer Motion for smooth animations.
    *   Ensured correct data fetching and display from Sanity CMS.
    *   Updated TypeScript interfaces (`City`, `SanityImage`) to match the Sanity schema, including proper image asset handling with dimensions.
    *   Refined Sanity queries (`cityProjection`, `getAllCities`) in `queries.js` for optimal data retrieval, especially for images.

2.  **City Carousel (`/components/listings/CityCarousel.tsx` & `/components/home/CitiesCarousel.tsx`):**
    *   Replaced/refactored the carousel using `embla-carousel-react` and `embla-carousel-autoplay`.
    *   Resolved all outstanding TypeScript errors and improved type definitions for `City` and related props.
    *   Implemented robust image loading with `next/image`, including `eager` loading for initial slides and `lazy` for others, plus fallback UI for missing images.
    *   Ensured responsive behavior: 1 card on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop.
    *   Added interactive navigation (previous/next buttons) and dot indicators, with appropriate disabled states.
    *   Configured and verified autoplay functionality.
    *   Styled with Tailwind CSS, including gradient overlays and hover effects for a modern look.

3.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Added `framer-motion` for animations across city pages and potentially other components.
    *   Updated `tailwind.config.js` with custom animation keyframes (`subtle-zoom`).
    *   Implemented a scroll-to-top component for better navigation on long pages.

## Technical Decisions & Patterns:

*   **Image Handling:** Standardized on using Sanity's image CDN via `next/image` for optimization. Fallback UI for missing images is crucial.
*   **State Management:** Primarily using React's `useState` and `useCallback` for component-level state in the carousel.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is the standard. Custom animations are added to `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Data Fetching:** Using async/await with Sanity client in Server Components for Next.js App Router.
*   **Error Handling:** Type guards and optional chaining are essential for robust component rendering, especially with potentially incomplete CMS data.

## Next Immediate Steps:

1.  **Final Carousel Verification:** Thoroughly test the city carousel on different devices and browsers to ensure it's displaying correctly and all functionalities (autoplay, navigation, responsiveness) are working as expected.
2.  **Documentation Update:** Update all relevant documentation files (`task_breakdown.md`, `sanity_integration.md`, `activeContext.md`, `sanity_implementation_plan.md`, `sanity_integration_status.md`, `.clinerules/clinerules.md`) to reflect the completed work and current project state.
3.  **City Page Links:** Test navigation to and from city pages, ensuring all links and dynamic routes are functioning correctly.
4.  **Performance Review:** Briefly assess page load times and animation smoothness for the new city pages and carousel.

## Broader Project Context Reminders:

*   **Sanity Integration:** Continue to ensure all data models and queries align with the Sanity schema.
*   **Python Scripts:** The Python migration scripts for listings and images are still pending completion.
*   **Authentication & User Features:** These are future tasks, but design decisions should keep them in mind (e.g., user-specific content).
