## Current Objectives

-   Focus on CMS Integration Preparation.
-   Research and compare CMS options.
-   Design content models.
-   Set up development environment.

## Recent Changes

-   Testing Implementation Phase âœ…
    -   Implemented Playwright testing framework
    -   Created comprehensive test utilities
    -   Added API mocking strategy
    -   Created thorough documentation
    -   Set up CI integration
-   Listing Display UI Refinements (Completed):
    - Implemented pagination on the main listings page (`app/listings/page.tsx`).
    - Added loading state indicators (initial load and during filter/sort changes) to `app/listings/page.tsx`.
    - Enhanced error/empty state handling with context-specific messages on `app/listings/page.tsx`.
    - Simplified `ListingGrid.tsx` by removing its internal "no listings" check.
    - Confirmed image optimization in `ListingCard.tsx`.

## Next Steps

1.  Research and compare CMS options
    -   Features comparison
    -   Pricing analysis
    -   Performance benchmarks
    -   Community support
    -   Integration complexity

2.  Design content models
    -   Map current data structure
    -   Plan for future features
    -   Consider relationships
    -   Define validation rules

3.  Set up development environment
    -   Local CMS instance
    -   API route structure
    -   Authentication flow
    -   Content preview mode

## Technical Considerations

-   Data migration strategy
-   Content versioning needs
-   Image asset management
-   API performance optimization
-   Cache invalidation strategy
-   Preview environments
-   Development workflow
-   Cluster performance with large datasets
-   Filter state management
-   Mobile-first design approach
-   Map state persistence
-   Loading state handling

## Open Questions

-   Self-hosted vs. managed CMS?
-   Content preview requirements?
-   Backup and restore strategy?
-   Content delivery architecture?
-   Media asset handling approach?
