# Active Context: ListingCard.tsx TypeScript Fixes

## What was done

- Fixed persistent TypeScript errors in `app-scaffold/src/components/listings/ListingCard.tsx`.
- All property accesses (e.g., `name`, `city`, `type`, `slug`) are now protected by type guards.
- All array mappings for tags and features are filtered to only operate on strings.
- Extracted safe variables (e.g., `listingName`) for use in JSX and props.
- Ensured compatibility with both Sanity and legacy listing data.
- The component now compiles and runs without type errors.

## Next Steps

- Test the homepage and city/listing pages to confirm correct rendering.
- Continue to use type guards and array filtering for any new fields or data sources.
- Reference this context for future work on listing-related components.
