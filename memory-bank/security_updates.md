- Added comprehensive dependency overrides in package.json
- Implemented security verification tools

### Performance Optimizations
- Added DOM detachment technique for large text blocks
- Implemented selective highlighting
- Added performance monitoring in verification script

### Scripts and Tools
- Enhanced patch-prismjs.js with better dependency handling
- Added verify-security.js for ongoing monitoring
- Updated package.json scripts for security checks

## Verification
- Security scans completed successfully
- Performance optimizations verified
- No breaking changes detected

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for new security advisories

- Consider updating to Sanity Studio v3 when available

# Security Updates Log

Last Updated: May 16, 2025

## Authentication System Updates

### Sanity Studio Security Enhancements

- Updated Sanity dependencies to latest secure versions
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) for studio features
- Added security headers and CSP configuration
- Enabled rate limiting for API endpoints
- Restricted Vision Tool access to development/admin only

### Authentication Testing Suite

- Added comprehensive test suite for authentication flows
- Implemented role-based access testing (admin, editor, contributor)
- Added session management tests
- Added API route protection tests
- Added integration tests for Sanity Studio synchronization

### Role-Based Access Implementation

1. Administrator
   - Full system access
   - User management capabilities
   - System settings access
   - Content management (create, edit, delete, publish)

2. Editor
   - Content creation and editing
   - Content publishing
   - Limited system settings access
   - No user management access

3. Contributor
   - Content creation and editing
   - Submit content for review
   - No direct publishing capabilities
   - No system settings access

### Security Measures

- Enhanced CORS configuration with allowed origins
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added file upload restrictions and validation
- Enhanced session management
- Added rate limiting protection
- Implemented secure headers (HSTS, XSS Protection, etc.)

### Testing Infrastructure

- Playwright test configuration for different roles
- Automated authentication state management
- Integration tests for cross-system authentication
- Session persistence validation
- API protection verification

## Future Considerations

- Regular security audits scheduled
- Monitoring of dependency vulnerabilities
- Continuous testing infrastructure improvements
- Regular review of access patterns and permissions
